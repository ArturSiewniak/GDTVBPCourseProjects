This repository contains all of my project files from GameDev.tv Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer Online Course.

Projects include: 
-Marble Run
-Crystal Caverns
-Mars Marine

Each of the folders contain bare minimum required to build the project in Unreal Engine versions 4.20 (I rebuilt them all up using Unreal Engine 4.20.3 so I can't say if there would be any compatibility problems on higher versions)

Due to GitHub constraints with file sizes I am unable to upload ready builds of these projects, so if needed I can send the builds via some host service.
